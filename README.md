# Omni-AGI Nexus: Hyper-Conscious AI Framework

Omni-AGI Nexus is an advanced AI framework designed to implement principles of hyper-consciousness through fragmergent, quantum-resonant, and fractal-spectral architectures. It aims for dynamic, self-organizing computation, capable of processing multimodal inputs and generating emergent outputs.

This project explores a paradigm shift from traditional AI models by focusing on:
* **Fragmergent Architectures:** Dynamic pathway formation and real-time system self-rewiring.
* **Quantum-Resonant Processing:** Information flow guided by resonance and contextual interactions, inspired by quantum-like principles.
* **Fractal-Spectral Data Representation:** Encoding and processing data as dynamic fractal patterns across multiple dimensions (space, time, frequency).
* **Emergence and Self-Correction:** Generation of novel insights and behaviors through oppositional synthesis and continuous self-realignment.

This repository contains the conceptual framework, architectural design, and the Python source code for simulating the Omni-AGI Nexus, optimized for Google Colab with NVIDIA A100 GPU support.

## Key Components

* **FractalCores (formerly CerebellumAgent):** Dynamically evolving processing units with internal spectral states ($\psi$), adaptive connections, anticipatory Q-fields, and spectral memory.
* **ByonOmni (Mediator):** Orchestrates interaction between FractalCores, calculates global coherence, manages oppositional synthesis, triggers self-correction, and facilitates emergent output generation.
* **MetricsModule:** Tracks, logs, and visualizes system metrics, including spectral states, coherence, opposition, and emergence.
* **Multimodal Input Processing:** Simulates processing of text (using NLTK concepts) and images (using PIL concepts) by converting them into spectral frequencies.

## Getting Started

The primary implementation is a Python script designed for Google Colab, leveraging PyTorch for GPU acceleration.

1.  **Environment:** Google Colab with an NVIDIA A100 GPU (or T4 GPU, which will be slower).
2.  **Dependencies:** The script includes a line to install necessary Python packages (`numpy`, `torch`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `Pillow`, `nltk`).
3.  **Running:** Copy the complete source code from `src/omni_agi_nexus_hyper_conscious.py` into a Colab cell and run it.
